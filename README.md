# Hello, folks! ğŸ‘‹

My name is Marco and I am not a random software developer:

- always putting myself in the perspective of the users
- love doing Scrum and push me and my team to new limits
- highly technically educated but knowing others can code better than me  
=> I am the "blabla guy" you want to have in your team ğŸ˜›
- linking the dots & having an extremely good eye for detail  
=> if there are any issues I will probably find them ğŸ˜‰
- never too shy to take action myself in development if required
