# Hello, folks! ðŸ‘‹

I am Marco, Senior Developer Relations Engineer at [DFINITY](https://github.com/dfinity), the core contributor to the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org) (ICP).

## Why build on ICP? ðŸš€
ICP makes the Internet into a World Computer and enables you to build anything without traditional IT and Big Tech. It hosts decentralized serverless compute thatâ€™s simpler, immune to cyber attack, unstoppable, and controllable by DAOs. Create web3 social networks and media, socialfi, games, multi-chain dapps, AI, or an enterprise app by leveraging following capabilities:

- [100% On-Chain Web Experience](https://internetcomputer.org/capabilities) - The Internet Computer is the only blockchain with canister smart contracts that can serve web by processing HTTP requests. This allows 100% of online services to run from the blockchain, which allows for full decentralization.
  -  [SEO Support](https://medium.com/dfinity/seo-support-for-100-on-chain-websites-built-on-the-internet-computer-19c951d73853) - Build and run dapps entirely on-chain while being discoverable on search engines with SEO.
- [Chain Fusion](https://internetcomputer.org/chainfusion) - Chain Fusion enables smart contracts to interact with multiple networks. This allows developers to build multichain use cases on various blockchains.
  - [Bitcoin Integration](https://internetcomputer.org/bitcoin-integration) - Leveraging Chain Fusion Technology, ICP canister smart contracts can hold a Bitcoin public key, sign transactions with it, and directly read and write to the Bitcoin network. Build incredible dapps that natively interact with the Bitcoin network.
  - [Extend Ethereum & Other Blockchains](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Extend_Bitcoin,_Ethereum_and_other_blockchains) - Using chain-key ECSDA signatures (advanced threshold ECDSA), the Internet Computer will integrate with Ethereum. Internet Computer smart contracts can access and use all digital assets like ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens from Ethereum, and smart contracts on Ethereum can use the power of IC smart contracts, e.g., low-cost storage and computation.
- [Daemon Contracts (Timers/Heartbeats)](https://internetcomputer.org/capabilities/daemon-contracts) - On the Internet Computer blockchain, you can create canister smart contracts that run like daemon processes â€” that is, you can configure them so that they are automatically activated by the network itself at specified block intervals.
- [DAOs](https://internetcomputer.org/sns) - The Internet Computer allows developers to turn their dapps into a DAO to achieve full decentralization â€” 100% on-chain.
- [Internet Identity](https://internetcomputer.org/internet-identity) - The Internet Computer has replaced the username and password model with a more advanced and much more secure method of cryptographic authentication that is more convenient, works across all of a user's devices, and helps protect user privacy. Based on W3C's Web Authentication (WebAuthn) Web standard. Using hardware-based user key protection.
- [Limitless Scaling](https://internetcomputer.org/capabilities/limitless-scaling) - The Internet Computer (IC) can scale its capacity simply by adding additional nodes to fuel new subnets. Nodes and subnets are added via the [Network Nervous System](https://internetcomputer.org/nns) (NNS). In contrast, most other blockchains have transaction limits baked into the protocol (e.g. adding more servers to Bitcoin does not increase its transaction volume) and need cumbersome layers to address scaling.
- [Randomness](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/advanced-features/randomness) - The Internet Computer provides a secure and verifiable way to generate random numbers directly within canisters.
- [Reverse Gas Model](https://internetcomputer.org/capabilities/reverse-gas) - A browser is all you need to interact with smart contracts on the Internet Computer. Developers pay for gas. End users access and use dapps without tokens.
- [WebAssembly](https://internetcomputer.org/capabilities/webassembly) - An advantage of the Internet Computer blockchain is its use of WebAssembly for executing smart contracts and decentralized applications â€” written in a wide variety of languages that compile to WebAssembly.
