# Hello, I'm Marco 👋

Senior DevRel at [DFINITY](https://github.com/dfinity), the core contributor to the [Internet Computer (ICP)](https://internetcomputer.org).

## What is the Internet Computer?
The IC is a decentralized cloud infrastructure that allows developers to deploy backend services without managing a traditional IT stack. It provides a sandboxed execution environment via WebAssembly (Wasm) where compute and storage are natively unified.

* **Unified Execution:** Code and state reside in the same unit (canisters). This eliminates the need for separate database servers, load balancers, or manual OS security patching.
* **Wasm-Native:** Develop in Rust, TypeScript, Python, or Motoko. Any language targeting WebAssembly can be deployed to the network, providing high-performance execution.
* **Orthogonal Persistence (Motoko):** When building with [Motoko](https://docs.internetcomputer.org/motoko), your variables and data structures persist in memory automatically across upgrades. The runtime manages the state on your behalf—no serialization or external database logic required.
* **Tamper-Proof Logic:** The platform uses threshold cryptography to ensure that code execution is consistently verifiable and immune to traditional single-point-of-failure attack vectors or root-access exploits.
